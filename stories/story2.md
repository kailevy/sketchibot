# SketchiBot: Progress Report 2
#### Comp Robo Fall 2015
#### Alex Crease, Jay Woo, Kai Levy

Hey all,
We are team Sketchibot, a team of three working with Neato's for our Computation Robotics class, aiming to create a drawing robot!

## The Goal
Simply put, our goal is to get the Neato to draw images inspired by visually-received, text-based prompts. That is, the robot will see a written prompt on it's camera. It will interpret that prompt and scour the web for an appropriate image, which it will then draw by moving around on a large piece of paper.
